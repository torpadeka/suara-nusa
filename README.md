## About Suara Nusa

_Suara Nusa_ (meaning "Voice of the Archipelago") is a comprehensive, AI-powered Next.js application designed to connect users with the diverse cultures of Indonesia. Our platform bridges the gap between tradition and technology, offering an immersive and educational experience for anyone interested in learning about Indonesia's languages, history, and traditions.

## ‚ú® Features

Suara Nusa is built upon three core pillars, each offering a unique way to engage with Indonesian culture:

### üó∫ Nusapedia: The Interactive Cultural Atlas

An immersive, map-based knowledge repository that allows users to explore Indonesia's history and culture through different eras.

-   _Interactive Timeline:_ Switch between different historical periods, including the "Kingdom Era," "Colonial Era," and "Modern Era."
-   _Dynamic Content:_ Click on historical sites, kingdoms, or provinces to open an interactive sidebar.
-   _AI-Powered Insights:_ The sidebar uses the Gemini AI to provide detailed, context-aware information, complete with a chatbot for follow-up questions.
-   _Visual Exploration:_ For ancient kingdoms, the map displays estimated territorial boundaries, offering a unique visual representation of their influence.

### Nusalingua: The Duolingo of Indonesian Languages

A gamified, Duolingo-like experience for learning Indonesia's regional languages, starting with Javanese.

-   _Interactive Lessons:_ Engage with a variety of exercises, including multiple-choice questions, translations, and fill-in-the-blanks.
-   _Gamified Progress:_ Track your learning journey with experience points (XP), streaks, and achievements to stay motivated.
-   _Structured Learning Path:_ Advance through different levels, from basic greetings in a traditional village to more complex conversations in a modern city.

### ü§ñ Nusatech: The IoT-Powered Language Bridge

A real-time language translation service that connects with IoT devices, allowing for seamless communication in local Indonesian languages.

-   _Live Translation:_ Connect a microphone-equipped IoT device and get real-time Javanese-to-Indonesian translations.
-   _Cloud-Powered:_ Utilizes Google's Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcriptions and the Gemini AI for nuanced translations.
